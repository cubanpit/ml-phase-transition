# Ising Learning

### Analyse phase transitions with neural networks

This is an exam project for a master course on ''Statistical Methods for Learning''.

The repository includes C++ simulations of physical systems and Python Keras/Tensorflow code for the neural networks part.

Simulated physical systems:

 - Ising on square lattice, with 4 nearest neighbours (Wolff algorithm)
 - Ising on honeycomb lattice, with 3 nearest neighbours (Wolff algorithm)
 - Ising on triangular lattice, with 6 nearest neighbours (Metropolis algorithm)
 - XY model on square lattice, with 4 nearest neighbours (Wolff algorithm)
